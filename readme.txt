Couldn't get the history function to work. 


Description:

This is a small shell designed to replicate the functionality of many
Linux and UNIX shells. It has the ability to execute programs, and it 
counts the number of lines that have been executed. 

To compile mish, you need to use gcc 4.6.3 or something compatible. Mish
uses the posix I/O library, so it must be run from a linux machine.
